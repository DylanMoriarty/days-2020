notes: "<p>Today I drew a cat, gave it to a computer, and the computer made it look fantastically realistic.</p><p>Click the link to try it out yourself! If you haven't heard of Machine Learning yet, the idea is that we've previously trained a computer to look at 3000 or so images and and had it compare the similarities/differences in em. After running that for thousands of iterations, we now show it something new- our drawing, and ask it to infere what the result should be.</p><p>It's fantastically powerful exciting stuff.</p>"
