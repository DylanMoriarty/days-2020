notes: "<p>Over the last year I've had the privelage of working on Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team projects including <a href='http://www.missingmaps.org/'>Missing Maps</a>, their summit page, & a bunch of small things here and there.</p><p>To kick off the new year, I've opted to get more involved with the organization as a design gun-for-hire. HOT is full of a lot of incredibly clever folks working together to coordinate mapping efforts both premptively & following disasters.</p><p>So far I've enlisted myself on their Comms crew, and will hope to give their visuals some love. Look forward to it!</p>"
