notes: "<p>When we built out the Missing Maps site, we had hoped new folks would come along and make some awesome badge graphics for new ones when they were added. ...six months later, it didn't seem like anyone picked up the mantle there, so I went ahead and made a quick batch.</p><p>These are for badges related to taking care of mapping tasks. From top to bottom they are for: invalidating a 'completed' task, validating a 'completed' task, & for declaring a task complete.</p>"
