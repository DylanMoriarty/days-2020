# Days!

This is the second iteration on a [reverse calendar thing I built last year](https://github.com/DylanMoriarty/days). The notion being that I have a hard time writing about what I'm up to, but I'm up to a lot. Luckily for me, it's mostly visual. So here we are!

Updated (roughly) weekly.

## Development environment
To set up the development environment for this website, you'll need to install the following on your system:

- [Node and npm](http://nodejs.org/)
- Ruby and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/), preferably through something like [rvm](https://rvm.io/)

After these basic requirements are met, run the following commands in the website's folder:
```
$ npm install
```
Will also run `bower install` and  `bundle install`

### Getting started

```
$ npm run images --> Only the first time
$ npm run serve
```
